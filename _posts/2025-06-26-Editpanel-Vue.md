## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Used
- Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- Vite as build tool
- HTML5 + CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)
- Font Awesome for icons
- Gravatar for dynamic profile picture

## ‚ú® Features
- Editable Full Name, Email, and Password fields
- Toggle edit mode per field using icon buttons
- Gravatar integration (fallback to default image)
- Responsive and accessible layout
- Scoped and modular CSS for clean styling

## üí° How It Works
Each account field is managed as a reactive state in Vue. Clicking the pencil icon toggles edit mode for that field, displaying inputs with validation. The password section includes logic to handle secure changes without exposing stored credentials.
