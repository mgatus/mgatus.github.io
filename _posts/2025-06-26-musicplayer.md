The Simple Music Player is a lightweight audio interface that lets users play, pause, and switch between tracks with a clean and intuitive layout.

Built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates how to create a functional music player without relying on any frameworks or external libraries. It includes basic controls and dynamic track information updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Used
- HTML5 `<audio>` element
- CSS3 for layout and styling
- JavaScript for playback logic and interactivity

## üéµ Features
- Play, pause, and skip track controls
- Display current song title and artist
- Visual highlight of active track
- Responsive UI that adapts to screen sizes

## üí° How It Works
The player uses JavaScript to control audio playback and update the UI based on user interaction. Track data is stored in an array, and the player dynamically updates the current song info as users navigate through the playlist.
