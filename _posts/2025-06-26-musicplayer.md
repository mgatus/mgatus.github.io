The Music Player is a Vue.js-based app that offers a simple yet dynamic way to play and switch between audio tracks with a modern UI and smooth user experience.

Built using Vue 3 and Vite, this project showcases reactive data handling, component-based architecture, and clean audio control logic. It’s designed to be lightweight, responsive, and user-friendly — ideal for showcasing core Vue skills.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- Vue.js 3 (Composition API)
- Vite for fast development and build
- HTML5 `<audio>` element
- Scoped CSS modules

## 🎵 Features
- Play, pause, and skip between multiple tracks
- Display of current song title and artist
- Simple playlist management using reactive arrays
- Responsive layout and clean design

## 💡 How It Works
Each track is defined in a reactive array, and Vue’s reactivity system updates the UI in real-time. The audio element is controlled via refs and event bindings, while each control is wrapped in modular Vue components for maintainability.
