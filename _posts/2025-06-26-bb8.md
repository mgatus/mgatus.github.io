BB-8 CSS Animation is a creative front-end project that brings the Star Wars droid BB-8 to life using only HTML and CSS.
--more--
The project features a smooth rolling animation of BB-8, built purely with HTML5 elements and advanced CSS3 properties such as keyframes, transforms, and pseudo-elements. No JavaScript was used in the animation, making it a lightweight and accessible demonstration of what's possible with CSS alone.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Used
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and animation
- Keyframe animations, transforms, and responsive layout techniques

## üéØ Project Highlights
- Pure CSS animation of a rolling BB-8
- Responsive design
- Minimal and semantic markup
- Styled details like antennae, circular patterns, and head movement all done via CSS

## üí° How It Works
BB-8 is composed of multiple `div` elements styled to form the body, head, and details. Animation is handled using `@keyframes` to rotate the body and bounce the head, creating a smooth, lively rolling effect. The layout adapts to screen size to ensure the animation remains consistent across devices.
